# Overview

Organisations within Trakka represent institutions or groups of users, which may wish to manage their own users, 
and manage their own data within the system. 

The Organisation view is accessed by selecting `Organisation` from the left-hand menu bar. 
This will show you a view of the organisation to which your account belongs.
Within the organisation view, you will see two tabs:

### Samples

The organisation sample data view shows all samples owned by the organisation.
This view only shows selected metadata fields, which can be configured on request for your own organisation.

If you have the [Viewer role](/Reference/roles-and-permissions.md#organisation-roles) in your organisation's 
Owner group, you will see _all_ samples listed which are owned by your organisation.

If you do not have this role, you will only see samples listed if your organisation has
explicitly shared those samples with the organisation's Everyone group. In most cases,
you will see no samples listed.

### Members

The Members tab lists all members of the organisation. Click on a user to see their details and roles.

This list does not include users who are members of a different organisation but have been 
granted "guest roles", for instance, guest data uploader rights, within your organisation.
