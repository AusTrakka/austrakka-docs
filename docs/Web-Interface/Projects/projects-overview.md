# Projects

Projects on the Trakka platform are collections of sequence and metadata
records, together with analysis results where available. 

These projects may be records associated with specific outbreaks or ongoing disease investigations, and are usually pathogen specific.

Additional information for each project can be viewed by selecting the relevant entry in the “Projects” table

Users can contribute to a project by uploading sequence or metadata through the AusTrakka site (via the “upload” button) or via command line interface (CLI). 
Instructions on uploading can be found here (link)

In project views, you will find:

* Views of metadata, which may include sequence, sample and case metadata. 
In the case of an inter-jurisdictional investigation, the project may contain records owned and shared by different organisatons.
The metadata fields available through project views is specific to the project, and will include only fields which have been approved for that project. 
This metadata can be listed and queried in the Samples view, and visualised in the Trees and Plots views.
* Analysis results, both in the form of derived metadata values, and as phylogenetic trees in the Trees view.
* Interactive plots of sequence, sample and case metadata, and derived bioinformatic values. 
These are available in the Plots view and on the project dashboard. 
These are updated in real-time whenever new data is added to the project, and do not require a new analysis to be run.
* Approved proforma templates for uploading new sample records intended for use in this project. These templates specify the expected metadata fields and are used for data validation.
* Project members together with their project roles and permissions, in the Members tab.
