# Tree viewer

The tree viewer allows visualisation of phylogenetic trees. 
Phylogenetic trees are graphical representations of the genetic relationships between samples within a project. 

For information on how to read and interpret a phylogenetic tree, a useful reference is the  
[Nextstrain documentation](https://docs.nextstrain.org/en/latest/learn/interpret/how-to-read-a-tree.html) on reading phylogenetic trees. 

The `Trees` tab within a project will list all distinct trees generated by different analyses. This may include, for instance, 
a tree covering all sequences in the project which have passed QC, and optionally trees covering specific species or sub-types,
or any other distinct analyses appropriate to the project. Click on a listed tree to access the Tree Viewer page.
