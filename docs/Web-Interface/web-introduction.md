1. Whenever you are logged in to Trakka, on the left side of the screen you will see a sidebar. 
You can collapse and expand the sidebar using the `>>` icon. 
The sidebar gives you access to the following pages:
* **Dashboard**: this is the landing page when you log in. It gives an overview of data and projects.
* **Projects**: this page gives you access to all the projects you are a member of. 
* **Organisation**: this page gives you access to pages that are specific to your organisation. What you see here will depend on your roles and permissions within your organisation.
* **Upload**: the upload pages allow you to upload sequence data files and sample metadata.
* **Fields**: the fields page lists the metadata fields recognised by Trakka. In the case of controlled (i.e. categorical) fields, you can see the allowed values for the field.

2. At the top of the screen, you will see breadcrumbs showing the current navigation hierarchy. 
You can click on any level of the breadcrumb items to navigate back to the relevant page.

3. On some pages (Project, Organisation), you will see a set of tabs giving access to different views or functions within that page.


## Dashboard

The dashboard is the landing page once a successful login has occurred. 

A summary of the userâ€™s account will be displayed at the top of the landing page and gives a summary of all data available to 
the logged in user, including both shared data available through projects, and data available through the user's home organisation. 
This widget shows the total number of samples records available 
for viewing, the date of the most recent sequence upload, and the number of sample records without sequence data.

The dashboard also provides an overview of the active projects of which the user is a member. 
Projects can be sorted by name, the number of samples within the project, latest sample, latest sequence or the latest tree generated.
The sort order can be changed by clicking on the column header of the desired sort field.
To get more information on a specific project, click on the associated entry in the project summary table.
