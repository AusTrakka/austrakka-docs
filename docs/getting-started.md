# Getting Started 

## Getting help

For governance and data management questions, you can email `team@austrakka.net`.

If you need technical help with AusTrakka itself, you can click on the `Support` link in the bottom-left of
AusTrakka itself to submit a support request. You can also email `support@austrakka.net`, 
or contact your project lead, who will put you in touch.

## Invitation and logging in

AusTrakka uses a federated authentication system leveraging the University of Melbourne's 
Entra/Active Directory system. This means that in most cases, you will be able to log in 
to AusTrakka using your existing institutional credentials (i.e. your usual email address, 
and your institutional password). The AusTrakka team will not manage or have access to 
your password; that remains managed by your own institution, which will authenticate 
you for us each time you log in.

The steps for accessing AusTrakka are:

1. Contact `team@austrakka.net` to request access to AusTrakka. You will need to fill out a form 
specifying your requested access levels, which should be signed off by your lab head or institutional lead.
2. You will receive an email invitation, with a link you can follow to accept the 
invitation. This will allow you to use your institutional credentials. Accepting this 
invitation will not grant AusTrakka or the University access to any information other 
than that shared publicly by your institution (usually, this is just your name and your 
email address.)
3. After accepting this invitation, you should be able to log in at https://austrakka.net/ . 
Sometimes there may be a small delay between accepting the invitation and being able to log in.
