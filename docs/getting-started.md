# Getting Started 

## Getting help

If you need technical help with AusTrakka itself, you can email `austrakka-support@unimelb.edu.au`, or contact your project lead, who will put you in touch.

## Invitation and logging in

AusTrakka uses a federated authentication system leveraging the University of Melbourne's 
Active Directory system. This means that in most cases, you will be able to log in 
to AusTrakka using your existing institutional credentials (i.e. your usual email address, 
and your institutional password). The AusTrakka team will not manage or have access to 
your password; that remains managed by your own institution, which will authenticate 
you for us each time you log in.

The steps for accessing AusTrakka are:

1. You will receive an email invitation, with a link you can follow to accept the 
invitation. This will allow you to use your institutional credentials. Accepting this 
invitation will not grant AusTrakka or the University access to any information other 
than that shared publicly by your institution (usually, this is just your name and your 
email address.)
2. After accepting this invitation, you should be able to log in at https://portalprod.austrakka.net.au/ . 
Sometimes there may be a small delay between accepting the invitation and being able to log in.

## On your first log-in

You will find your institution's sample data under the `Samples` menu. Note that we are not 
currently using the `Projects` view for this data.

On your first log-in, you may find that there are very few columns displayed in the 
samples table. If this is the case, select the `Column Picker` from the top-right-hand 
corner of the samples table, and select the columns you would like to activate.

Sample data can be filtered, sorted, and exported using this tabular view.
